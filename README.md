# Drupal Development

## Introduction

Drupal is a powerful open-source content management system (CMS) used for building a wide range of websites, from personal blogs to enterprise-level applications. This guide provides an overview of general Drupal development principles and practices.

## Requirements

To get started with Drupal development, you will need the following:

- A web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)
- PHP (versions 7.4, 8.0, or 8.1 are recommended)
- A database server (e.g., MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL)
- Composer (for managing dependencies)

## Installation

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Download and Extract Drupal**:
   - Download the latest version of Drupal from [Drupal.org](https://www.drupal.org/download).
   - Extract the downloaded archive to your web server's document root.

2. **Set Up Database**:
   - Create a new database for your Drupal site.
   - Note down the database name, username, and password.

3. **Run the Drupal Installer**:
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your Drupal site.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation, providing the database details when prompted.

4. **Install Composer Dependencies**:
   - Navigate to your Drupal root directory in the terminal.
   - Run `composer install` to install necessary dependencies.

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

1. **Site Information**:
   - Navigate to `/admin/config/system/site-information` to set your site name, email address, etc.

2. **Modules**:
   - Enable and configure required modules by navigating to `/admin/modules`.

3. **Themes**:
   - Install and configure themes by navigating to `/admin/appearance`.

## Development Practices

### Coding Standards

- Follow the [Drupal Coding Standards](https://www.drupal.org/docs/develop/standards).
- Use the [Coder](https://www.drupal.org/project/coder) module to check your code against these standards.

### Version Control

- Use Git for version control.
- Keep your `main` branch stable and create feature branches for new development.

### Testing

- Write tests for your code using Drupal's testing framework.
- Run tests using the command: `phpunit`.
